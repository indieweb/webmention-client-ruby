- Crawl a URL for mentioned URLs.

- Send webmentions to one or more mentioned URLs (and optionally include a [vouch](https://indieweb.org/Vouch) URL).
- Verify that a received webmention's source URL links to a target URL (and optionally verify that a vouch URL mentions the source URL's domain).

## Getting Started

Before installing and using webmention-client-ruby, you'll want to have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) 2.7 (or newer) installed. It's recommended that you use a Ruby version managment tool like [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv), [chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby), or [rvm](https://github.com/rvm/rvm).

webmention-client-ruby is developed using Ruby 2.7.6 and is additionally tested against Ruby 3.0 and 3.1 using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/indieweb/webmention-client-ruby/actions).

## Installation

If you're using [Bundler](https://bundler.io) to manage gem dependencies, add webmention-client-ruby to your project's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'webmention'
```

‚Ä¶and run `bundle install` in your shell.

To install the gem manually, run the following in your shell:

```sh
gem install webmention
```

## Usage

See [USAGE.md](https://github.com/indieweb/webmention-client-ruby/blob/main/USAGE.md) for documentation of webmention-client-ruby's features.

## Migrating to version 6

webmention-client-ruby was completely rewritten for version 6 to better support new features and future development. Some notes on migrating to the new version:

‚ôªÔ∏è **Renamed:** for clarity and consistency, the `Webmention.send_mention` method has been renamed `Webmention.send_webmention`. Both methods use the same interface.

‚ùå **Removed:** the `Webmention.client` method has been removed in favor of the additional module methods [noted above](#usage). While the underlying `Webmention::Client` class still exists, its interface has changed and its direct usage is generally unnecessary.

‚ùå **Removed:** `Webmention::Client#send_all_mentions` has been removed in favor of `Webmention.send_webmentions`. Combine `Webmention.mentioned_urls` and `Webmention.send_webmentions` to achieve similar results.

üõ† **Refactored:** Exception handling has been greatly improved [as noted above](#exception-handling).
