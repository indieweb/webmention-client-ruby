# Since git version 2.23, git-blame has a feature to ignore certain commits.
#
# This file contains a list of commits that are not likely what you are looking
# for in `git blame`. You can set this file as a default ignore file for blame
# by running the following command:
#
# $ git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
